IAM policies:
    If you have an IAM group, called 'Developers', all members that are part of that IAM group inherit the policies from that group. A policy in an
    IAM group dictates what users of that group are able to do.  
    An IAM policy is structured as JSON. 

    Consists of:
        Version: Policy language version
        Id: A policy identifier
        Statement: One or more individual statements

    Statement consists of:
        Sid: an identifier for the statement
        Effect: Whether the statement allows or denies access
        Principal: Account/user/role to which this policy applies
        Action: List opf actions this policy allows or denies
        Resources: List of resources to which the actions apply
        Condition: Conditions for when this policy is in effect

    
IAM - Password policy
    Stronger password theoretically makes a stronger account
    In AWS, you can set up a password policy:
        Set a minimum password length
        Require specific character types:
            Includes upper case letters 
            Lower case letters
            Numbers
            Non-alphanumeric characters
    Requires all users to change their password after some time (expiration policy)
    Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
    Prevent password re-use


    MFA:
        Password you know + security device that you own: we want to protect our root account and IAM user account(s)
        Main benefit of MFA:
            If a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised

        MFA devices options in AWS:
            Virtual MFA device:
                Google Authenticator
                Authy: 
                    Support for multiple tokens on a single device

            U2F security key (physical key):
                Supports multiple root and IAM users using a single security key
